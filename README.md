# professional-statement
I am currently a state auditor looking into changing careers to cybersecurity. I like the idea of testing and improving users' security so they're free to work and enjoy their experience safely. I don't have a lot of transferable academic skills from my bachelor's in accounting, but I'm diving headfirst into certifications and trainings to build a strong foundation. I made the switch from music education to accounting while getting great grades along the way, so being adaptable again while switching to cybersecurity doesn't intimidate me. What does intimidate me is the amount of cybersecurity knowledge out there.
